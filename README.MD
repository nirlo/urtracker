# UrTracker
Django based Wellness tracker.  

The purpose is to track my well being and see if there is any correlation with use of particular supplements, a SAD Lamp, or exercise. 


# Set up

TBD

# Future Features
I want to add some kind of front end and make it a little easier to use. I would like a automated way of reminding me to input my data. 

My hope is that the front end will also give a visualization of the year overall
